    Inside the Collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, And What Regulators Should Have Done Differently </h1>

<p> Minus a few people, for the longest time the name Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) likely meant very little to the average person. Until that very name popped up on just about every TV, laptop, mobile phone, or Twitter business push notification on a headline or thread that might have read, “Silicon Valley Bank Collapses.” A grocery list of reasons to raise the alarm, especially when many people in the U.S. already feared a recession. </p>

<p> For perspective, banks close almost every year, and it's no secret. It's just not always talked about on CNN or written in the Wall Street Journal. However, in the case of SVB, it's not every day that a bank loses $209 billion in assets and is forced to file for bankruptcy. </p>

<p> Not to mention, that number, $209 billion, is the largest loss of bank assets since the 2008 financial crisis when Washington Mutual closed its doors. </p>

<p> The collapse of SVB was a culmination of several factors, investments were losing value, depositors were withdrawing large amounts of money in a short period, and a lack of diversity in SVB's portfolio. However, according to a report written by the <a href="federalreserve.gov/publications/files/svb-review-20230428.pdf//">Federal Reserve</a>, blame was ultimately attributed (and there was a fair share of blame to go around) to the bank's management, the regulator, and social media, specifically Reddit and Twitter. </p>

<p> SVB saw a meteoric rise in customer deposits driven by its close ties to the tech industry. Young ventures and startups, rich with funding from a historically low-interest rate environment, had lots of cash on hand and deposited loads of funds with SVB which caused the bank’s balance sheet to swell with deposits (liabilities). Most of these deposits were held as cash, but the excess was used to purchase relatively low-risk long-term assets. Now, why could this be problematic? </p>

<p> "For a Bank to function it must adequately match its deposits with loans or other assets, it’s critical for a bank to match both yield and tenor (maturity date) with the estimated duration of the deposits in which it uses to make loans," Riley Lowe said, an Analyst at Key Bank Capital Markets.</p>

<p> "If not, they [SVB] will have to sell, potentially at a loss, their assets before maturity, in order to fund depositor needs," Lowe added."  </p>

<p> This is exactly what happened. To accommodate these large withdrawals, SVB was forced into a situation where it had to sell some of its investments at a loss. March 8, 2023, SVB lost $1.8 billion on its bond portfolio, this marked what some referred to as "the beginning of the end" for the bank. </p>

<p> Today, after monitoring and analyzing the situation very closely, the question on everyone's mind is what should have been done differently? Not that there's a perfect answer, but something needed to be done so all of this might have been avoided.</p>

<p>  According to the FDIC, account holders with uninsured deposits tend to be much more sensitive to bad news, including changing interest rates, new inflation numbers, or bank woes. </p>

When in fact, almost 94% of SVB's deposits were uninsured, meaning that any amount of money over $250,000 would not be insured by the <a href="https://www.fdic.gov/resources/deposit-insurance/faq/index.html//">FDIC</a>. For banks, a large proportion of uninsured deposits poses a number of risks. </p>


<div class=graphic> 

<iframe title="Top Banks by Proportion of Uninsured Deposits" aria-label="Bar Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-F0bW6" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/F0bW6/3/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="876" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();

"SVB had an outsized share of deposits that were not insured by the FDIC meaning the bank’s deposit base was highly ‘chunky’ in nature and a large withdraw by a core customer could mean a massive swing in deposit base," Lowe added. "Depositors were scantily assuaged that their deposits would be backstopped, which led to an extremely high withdraw rate (as a portion of accounts)."

<p> SVB and regulators should have closely monitored the makeup of their deposit base. Midsize depository institutions are normally customarily funded via consumer accounts, which leads to a highly diversified depositor base. However, SVB's deposits were highly concentrated from large tech companies, who, when in financial trouble, began withdrawing funds from their accounts. </p>

<p> Once SVB’s core depositors (young tech companies) began to face a cash crunch driven by rising interest rates and general economic tightening, they began to withdraw deposits at an abnormally higher rate than usual. SVB started facing liquidity challenges to fund depositors and in turn, began to attempt to sell some of their assets. </p>

<p> After the 2008 financial crisis, the U.S. enacted the <a href="https://www.fdic.gov/resources/deposit-insurance/faq/index.html//"> Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act</a>. The major banking regulation that sought to prevent high-risk lending that inevitably led to the events that took place in 2008. In line with Dodd-Frank, banks with more than $50 billion in assets would be monitored more closely and subject to certain other rules and regulations. SVB would be one of those banks. However, in 2018 when Donald Trump signed into law the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/2155//">Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act</a>, that number changed drastically. The regulation changed the requirement from $50 billion to $250 billion.  </p>


<p>Before the law changed in 2018, SVB was watched much more closely by regulators as its $209 billion in assets was well over that $50 billion threshold, however, that was no longer the case after Trump's new law raised that requirement to $250 billion. </p>

<p>So, even though SVB at the time was the 16th largest bank in the U.S., it was not subject to these extra rules and oversight that were put into place to prevent exactly what took place on March 10. </p>
